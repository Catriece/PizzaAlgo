Determine the type of pizza you would like to eat
Decide which business you'd like to order from
    (This could be due to a favorite restaurant or current deals/specials a certain business is running)
Locate contact information for that business
    typically done via internet but if internet is not available check a phonebook
Call the preferred business
Place your order and decided how you will make the payment
If wrong order is brought to your address, call business back immediately before eating
